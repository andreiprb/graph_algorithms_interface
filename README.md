# Graph algorithms interface

#### Project showcasing and testing the following algorithms':
- DFS (recursive and iterative), BFS
- CC/SCC, Topological Sort
- MST Algorithms: Prim, Kruskal, Boruvka
- Shortest path Algorithms: Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford
- Flow Algorithms: Ford-Fulkerson, Cycle Cancelling Algorithm

For the interface, containing all algorithms, run interface.py
For running the shortest path algorithms, run luxembourg.py
For running the MST, SP and Flow algorithms on the graph generator (erdos-Renyi model), run generator.py with VERBOSE=True
For testing the MST, SP and Flow algorithms on the graph generator (erdos-Renyi model), run generator.py with VERBOSE=False

#### Note: For the graph generator, MST algorithms run only on undirected graphs; SP and Flow algorithms run only on directed graphs.
